# Project Rules

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change Approval Process

**BEFORE making ANY changes to files:**

1. ✅ **ALWAYS explain what you're going to change and why**
2. ✅ **ALWAYS ask for permission before modifying files**
3. ✅ **ALWAYS show the specific changes you plan to make**
4. ✅ **ALWAYS wait for explicit approval before proceeding**

## Change Request Format

When proposing changes, use this format:

```
**Proposed Change:**
- File: [filename]
- Reason: [why this change is needed]
- What will change: [specific details]
- Impact: [what this affects]

**May I proceed with this change?**
```

## Exceptions

- Reading files (no permission needed)
- Creating new files (still explain what and why)
- Terminal commands (explain what they do)
